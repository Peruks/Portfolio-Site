ABOUT ME:
I’m a disciplined and curious learner who believes in improving a little every day. My career path wasn’t linear, but every phase built a different strength that now gives me a unique edge in the tech field.
My background has shaped a strong foundation:
- TNPSC Preparation — built elite discipline, patience, deep focus, and the ability to learn for long hours without supervision.
- UST Global — exposed me to corporate systems, networking fundamentals, troubleshooting, and operational responsibility.
- Tech Exploration (AI, Data, Web3) — showed me that I thrive in hands-on technical environments and enjoy learning modern tools.
Today, I’m not exploring different paths anymore — I have complete clarity.
Data & AI is the field I want to grow in, and I’m fully committed to this direction.

WHY DATA & AI?:
I chose Data & AI because it aligns with who I am — logical, analytical, and focused on improvement. This field rewards skill over background and consistency over credentials. It combines everything I enjoy: finding patterns, analyzing information, solving problems, and learning continuously. It’s a career path where effort directly converts into growth, and that’s exactly what motivates me.

VALUE PROPOSITION:
1. Unwavering Clarity: I’m not testing the waters. I’ve made a mature, informed decision to build my career in this field and I am committed long-term.
2. Proven Discipline: Years of 8–10 hours/day focused preparation taught me consistency, time management, and deep concentration.
3. Technical Maturity: I already understand systems, networks, and troubleshooting from my corporate experience at UST Global — I am not starting from zero.
4. Independent Learner: I know how to research, troubleshoot, understand documentation, and upgrade myself without constant hand-holding.
5. The Hunger Factor: I’m restarting my career with a clear purpose. I have something to prove — and that drive shows in my effort, consistency, and mindset.
Quote: “Fresh graduates bring energy. I bring energy + discipline + maturity + commitment.”
